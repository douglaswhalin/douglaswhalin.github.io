This year we are holding the seventh international Byzantine seminar series at the Institute for Ancient History (IHAC) at Northeast Normal University (NENU), Changchun, Jilian Province, China. The event is organized in collaboration with the Department of Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies at the University of Cologne and the Department of Historical and Classical Studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. These seminars provide a great opportunity for the graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at NENU to engage directly with foreign researchers and learn about current and ongoing research projects. This year we are featuring four speakers presenting on the them of ‘Byzantine Diplomacy in a Global Perspective.’

This is the first year that I gave a paper for this event, titled ‘Strategy, diplomacy, and the first Arab siege of Constantinople’. After giving an overview of the sources for this period, I proposed a reconstruction of the sequence of events focusing on the diplomatic decision-making processes at play for both Roman and Arab authorities. I argued that the contradictory nature of the accounts was a product of the long-term difficulties of establishing consensus among various political powers within the Roman ruling elite. My thanks to everyone who tuned in to our virtual seminar and contributed great and thoughtful questions and feedback during the discussion session! I hope to see you at the rest of the events we have scheduled.
