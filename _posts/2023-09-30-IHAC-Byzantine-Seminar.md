This year we are holding the seventh international Byzantine seminar series at the Institute for Ancient History (IHAC) at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilian Province, China. The event is organized in collaboration with the Department of Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies at the University of Cologne and the Department of Historical and Classical Studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. These seminars provide a great opportunity for the graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at NENU to engage directly with foreign researchers and learn about current and ongoing research projects. This year we are featuring four speakers presenting on the them of ‘Byzantine Diplomacy in a Global Perspective.’

This is the first year that I will be giving a paper for this event, titled ‘Strategy and diplomacy in the first Arab siege of Constantinople’. As has been the case for the last few years, this seminar series will also be held online. Please follow the directions on the poster to get a link to the event!
