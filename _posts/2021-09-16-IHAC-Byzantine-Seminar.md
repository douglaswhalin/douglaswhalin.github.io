This year I will help host the Byzantine seminar series as part of being a Visiting Professor for the Institute for the History of Ancient Civilization (IHAC) at Northeast Normal University (NENU), Changchun, People’s Republic of China. The event is organized in collaboration with the Department of Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies at the University of Cologne and the Department of Historical and Classical Studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. This year’s event will be online due to the ongoing plague, which means it will be more accessible for people from all over the world to join.

This year’s lectures will feature five speakers who will present on the theme ‘Networks and Connectivity.’ Each lecture will last approximately an hour, followed by a 30-minute question-and-answer period. Thanks to my colleague Prof Li Qiang for sorting out the poster!
