A new academic year, a new seminar series! This year I will again co-host the Byzantine seminar series as part of being a Visiting Professor for the Institute for the History of Ancient Civilization (IHAC) at Northeast Normal University (NENU), Changchun, Peope’s Republic of China. The event is organized in collaboration with the Department of Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies at the University of Cologne and the Department of Historical and Classical Studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. This year we will feature four speakers presenting on the topic of ‘Realism in hagiography.’

This year’s topic is part of a larger project I am coordinating along with Prof Dr Claudia Sode (Cologne) exploring new methods for teaching and reading hagiography through a realist paradigm. In addition to this seminar series, the project includes graduate classes that we are both teaching this semester (in IHAC and Cologne respectively) and a workshop which will be held at the University of Cologne in January 2023 with the support of the Erich Auerbach Institute for Advanced Studies.
