I am interested in the social history of the Eastern Roman ('Byzantine') Empire as well as eastern Christian literary sources (specifically Greek, Coptic and Syriac) in the First Millennium, and Late Antiquity specifically.

<h3> Research interests </h3>
I am a scholar primarily focused on the Roman Empire of the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods (approximately AD 300-1000). My research interests include the history of the Hellenophone and Mediterranean worlds in antiquity and the early middle ages; Classical and Medieval Greek language and literary culture; and hagiography, heterodoxy, and 'popular' belief in the Orthodox and Muslim worlds. My first monograph, *Roman Identity from the Arab Conquest to the Triumph of Orthodoxy* explored how the contours of Roman group identity changed in the period of the period from the mid-seventh through the mid-ninth centuries AD.

<br> Ongoing and future projects include a comparative study of literary landscape and work on ninth-century hagiographies and a study of travel and travelogues in the Late Antique Aegean. I'm also interested in the languages and literatures of other eastern Christian communities, particularly Syriac and Coptic.

<h3> Teaching </h3>
Since 2021 I am a visiting professor of Byzantine history at the Institute for the History of Ancient Civilization (IHAC) at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, PR China. Graduate courses include a two-semester sequence on material culture in Later Roman and Early Byzantine periods, and reading classes in medieval Greek on select authors.
